# Node.js Basics

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript on the server side. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications. With built-in modules like `http` for creating servers and `fs` for file operations, Node.js provides essential tools for backend development. Additionally, by leveraging npm (Node Package Manager), developers can easily manage and include third-party libraries to enhance functionality. Whether you're reading files, handling HTTP requests, or managing asynchronous operations, Node.js is designed to deliver high performance and flexibility for server-side JavaScript applications.
